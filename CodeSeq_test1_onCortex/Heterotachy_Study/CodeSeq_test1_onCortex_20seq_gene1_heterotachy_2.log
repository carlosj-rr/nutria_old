Host:    gallonegro (AVX, 7 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s CodeSeq_test1_onCortex_20seq_gene1.fas -m JC+H2 -pre CodeSeq_test1_onCortex_20seq_gene1_heterotachy_2
Seed:    13785 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Fri Jun  7 14:35:49 2019
Kernel:  AVX - 1 threads (4 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 4 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
