Host:    gallonegro (AVX, 7 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s CodeSeq_test1_onCortex_all_gene2.fas -m TEST -pre CodeSeq_all_gene2_modTest
Seed:    855099 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Wed Jun 12 16:56:09 2019
Kernel:  AVX - 1 threads (4 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 4 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file CodeSeq_test1_onCortex_all_gene2.fas ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 400 sequences with 1500 columns, 112 distinct patterns
760 parsimony-informative, 5 singleton sites, 735 constant sites
