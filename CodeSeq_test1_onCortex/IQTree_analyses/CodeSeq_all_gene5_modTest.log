Kernel:  AVX - 1 threads (4 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 4 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file CodeSeq_test1_onCortex_all_gene5.fas ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 400 sequences with 1500 columns, 150 distinct patterns
